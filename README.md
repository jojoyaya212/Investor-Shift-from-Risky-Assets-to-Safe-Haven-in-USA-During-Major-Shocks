# Investor Shift from Risky Assets to Safe Haven in USA During Major Shocks

## üìå Overview
This project investigates whether investors in the U.S. shift from risky assets (S&P 500 index) to safe haven assets (gold futures) during major shocks. Using **R** for econometric modeling, the study analyzes two events:
- The **COVID-19 pandemic (2020)**
- The **2025 U.S. tariff disturbances**

The project applies realized correlation, rolling regression, and dummy variable testing to quantify investor behavior during turbulent periods.

## üìä Key Findings
- Investors shifted to gold during major shocks, with **negative and statistically significant correlation** observed.  
- The **2025 tariff disturbance** had a **larger impact** than COVID-19, reflecting stronger market uncertainty.  
- The safe-haven effect was **short-lived and lagged**, rather than persistent.  
- No significant safe-haven dynamics were found during peaceful, non-shock periods.  
- Broader windows diluted the effect, showing that the reaction is sharp but temporary.

## üß™ Methods
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Downloaded daily S&P 500 (^GSPC) and gold futures (GC=F) data from Yahoo Finance (2010‚Äì2025).  
   - Used `quantmod::getSymbols()`.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Computed descriptive statistics (mean, std, skewness, kurtosis).  
   - Plotted price trends, histograms of log returns, and scatter plots.  

3. **Realized Correlation**  
   - Calculated 21-day rolling realized variance, covariance, and correlation.  
   - Visualized rolling correlation and volatility.  

4. **Event Study with Regression**  
   - Model:  
     ```math
     œÅ_t = Œ± + Œ≤œÅ_{t-1} + Œ¥¬∑ShockDummy_t + u_t
     ```  
   - Dummy windows tested via **p-value heatmaps**.  
   - Separate models for COVID-19 and tariff shocks.  
   - Controlled for autocorrelation/heteroskedasticity using **BG, BP tests, and Newey‚ÄìWest robust errors**.

## üöÄ Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Investor-Shift-from-Risky-Assets-to-Safe-Haven.git
   ```
2. Open **Investor-Shift_code.R** in R or RStudio.
